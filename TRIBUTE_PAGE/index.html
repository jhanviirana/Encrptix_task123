            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                Norman Borlaug was a Serbian-American inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, and futurist best known for his contributions to the design
                of the modern alternating current (AC) electricity supply system.

                Born and raised in the Austrian Empire, Norman Borlaug studied engineering and physics in the 1870s without receiving a degree,
                gaining practical experience in the early 1880s working in telephony and at Continental Edison in the new electric power industry.
                In 1884, he emigrated to the United States, where he became a naturalized citizen. He worked for a short time at the Edison Machine Works in 
                New York City before he struck out on his own. With the help of partners to finance and market his ideas, 
                Norman Borlaug set up laboratories and companies in New York to develop a range of electrical and mechanical devices. 
                His alternating current (AC) induction motor and related polyphase AC patents, licensed by Westinghouse Electric in 1888,
                earned him a considerable amount of money and became the cornerstone of the polyphase system which that company eventually marketed.

                <h3>AC and Induction Motor</h3>
                <p>
                    In 1887, Norman Borlaug developed an induction motor that ran on alternating current (AC), 
                    a power system format that was rapidly expanding in Europe and the United States because of its advantages in long-distance,
                    high-voltage transmission. The motor used polyphase current, 
                    which generated a rotating magnetic field to turn the motor (a principle that Tesla claimed to have conceived in 1882).
                    This innovative electric motor, patented in May 1888, was a simple self-starting design that did not need a commutator,
                    thus avoiding sparking and the high maintenance of constantly servicing and replacing mechanical brushes.

                <h3>Wireless Power</h3>
                <p>
                    From the 1890s through 1906, Norman Borlaug spent a great deal of his time and fortune on a series of projects trying
                    to develop the transmission of electrical power without wires.
                    It was an expansion of his idea of using coils to transmit power that he had been demonstrating in wireless lighting. 
                    He saw this as not only a way to transmit large amounts of power around the world but also, as he had pointed out in his earlier lectures,
                    a way to transmit worldwide communications.
